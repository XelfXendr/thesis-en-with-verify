%%% Set up bibliography formatting
% CHECK THE REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR DEPARTMENT AND FACULTY ON THE CITATION FORMAT!
%
% These are relatively "safe" default options that most people use:
%\usepackage[natbib,style=numeric,sorting=none]{biblatex}
% alternative with alphanumeric citations (more informative than numbers, and
% more common in computer science journals):
%\usepackage[natbib,style=alphabetic]{biblatex}
%
% ALTERNATIVES THAT CONFORM TO ISO 690
% ISO 690 is not the greatest citation format ever, but may be formally
% required at Charles University, depending on your faculty and department.
\usepackage[natbib,style=iso-numeric,sorting=none]{biblatex}
%\usepackage[natbib,style=iso-alphabetic]{biblatex}
% You might want to add extra options such as `maxbibnames=6,maxcitenames=2`
% here to further conform to some of the formatting requirements (see below for
% details). Again, consult your faculty rules.
%
% Additional option choices:
%  - add `giveninits=true` to typeset "E. A. Poe" instead of full Edgar Allan
%  - `terseinits=true` additionaly shortens it to nature-like "Poe EA"
%  - add `maxnames=10` to limit (or loosen) the maximum number of authors in
%    bibliography entry before shortening to `et al.` (useful when referring to
%    book collections that may have hundreds of authors)
%  - use `maxcitenames=2` to finetune the amount of authors listed in text-cite
%    commands (\citet). Corresponding option that only affects the bibliography
%    is `maxbibnames=10`.
%  - `sorting=none` causes the bibliography list to be ordered by the order of
%    citation as they appear in the text, which is usually the desired behavior
%    with numeric citations. Additionally you can use a style like
%    `numeric-comp` that compresses the long lists of citations such as
%    [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] to simpler [1--8]. This is especially useful if you plan
%    to add tremendous amounts of citations, as usual in life sciences and
%    bioinformatics.
%  - if you don't like the "In:" appearing in the bibliography, use the
%    extended style (`ext-numeric` or `ext-alphabetic`), and add option
%    `articlein=false`.
%
% Possibly reverse the names of the authors with the non-ISO styles:
%\DeclareNameAlias{default}{family-given}
%
% Use caps-and-small-caps for family names in ISO 690 style.
